- ✓ Determine top vendors contributing the most to sales and gross profit.  
- ✓ Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs.  
- ✓ Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs and improve efficiency.  
- ✓ Investigate profitability variance between high-performing and low-performing vendors.
